General Overview

X - as a DLL, to be run inside a simulator
  - future: As a Windows process, maybe a service down the line, if it wants/needs to run automatically

X Main loop: continuous loop to do self diagnostics, respond to sensory input and perform actions, reflection to re-evaluate for patterns and improvement.

X Process Theory: stimulus exists -> senses pick them up -> diagnosis on senses -> needs created -> evaluation of needs against priorities -> solution creation and planning -> perform actions

core attributes: 
X  - physical health - air, water, nutrients, lack of pain, lack of disease, energy 
X  - situational optimization - safety, equipment, stockpiling, preparations
X  - capabilities - able to sense, able to take actions, optimization and efficiency improvements
X  - acceptable parameters

core abilities: 
X  - senses, diagnostics, evaluations, performing actions
  
Senses:
X  - see, feel, taste, smell, hear
X  - independent threads that create input
X - create 'evaluate' needs
 - initial filter to minimize 'noise' by recognition and patterning.  Also compare against existing needs
 
Diagnostics:
X - check all core attributes within acceptable parameters (if not, add needs)
X - check all sensory systems performing (if not, add needs)

Evaluate action:
- (if there are no outstanding critical needs, then be proactive)
- threat detection
- benefit opportunity

Needs:
X - urgency and importance
X - improve core attribute
X - improve sensors
X - improve (action) abilities

Evaluation of needs to find solutions:
X - check needs have 1+ solutions
X - first pass, just look up solution records that match the need.
 - future enhancement - extrapolate solution chains (find, make, consume, etc.)
 - future enhancement - create new solutions from related solutions
 - future enhancement - create new solutions from knowledge

Solutions:
X - has a benefit - meet a need to a certain extent
X - 1+ actions to accomplish

Entity Action:
X - use ability
X - optionally have item
X - optionally have environment
X - optionally have target location or item
X - has an ActionCost

ActionCost:
X - negative impact to something
X - time, energy, item, sensory efficiency, ability efficiency


Abilities:
X - within self: wake/sleep, change position (stand up, sit down, lie down), move, proactively use senses, evaluate
X - with object: pick up, carry, put down, throw, equip, unequip, use
X - with entity: socially interact positively (befriend), negatively (confront), physically interact positively (aid, mate), negatively (fight)
