general overview

As a Windows process, maybe a service down the line, if it wants/needs to run automatically

main loop: continuous loop to do self diagnostics, respond to sensory input and perform actions, reflection to re-evaluate for patterns and improvement.

core attributes: 
 - physical health - air, water, nutrients, lack of pain, lack of disease, energy 
 - situational optimization - safety, equipment, stockpiling, preparations
 - capabilities - able to sense, able to take actions, optimization and efficiency improvements
 - acceptable parameters
 - urgency and importance

Senses:
 - see, feel taste, smell, hear
 - independent threads that create input
 - initial filter to minimize 'noise' by recognition and patterning.  Also compare against existing needs
 - create 'evaluate' needs
 
abilities: 
 - reactive sensories: see, feel, taste, smell, hear
 - proactive actions: move, consume, manipulate, produce 
  
Self Diagnostics:
 - check all core attributes within acceptable parameters (if not, add solutions)
 - check all sensory systems performing (if not, add solutions)
 - check solutions have actions

Evaluate action:
 - threat detection
 - benefit opportunity

Evaluation of needs to find solutions:
 - first pass, just look up solution records that match the need.
 - future enhancement - extrapolate solution chains (find, make, consume, etc.)
 - future enhancement - create new solutions from related solutions
 - future enhancement - create new solutions from knowledge

Needs:
 - evaluate an unknown input
 - improve core attribute
 - improve abilities
 - 

Solutions:
 - meet a need
 - 1+ actions to accomplish
 - have a cost (energy, time, resources, etc.)
