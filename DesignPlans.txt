general overview

As a Windows process, maybe a service down the line, if it wants/needs to run automatically

main loop: continuous loop to do self diagnostics, respond to sensory input and perform actions

core attributes: 
 - physical health - air, water, nutrients, lack of pain, lack of disease, energy 
 - situational optimization - safety, equipment, stockpiling, 
 - capabilities - able to sense, able to take actions
 - acceptable parameters
 - urgency and importance
 
abilities: 
 - reactive sensories: see, feel, taste, smell, hear
 - proactive actions: move, consume, manipulate, produce 
  
Self Diagnostics:
 - check all core attributes within acceptable parameters (if not, add solutions)
 - check all sensory systems performing (if not, add solutions)
 - check solutions have actions



Evaluation of needs to find solutions:
 - first pass, just look up coorection records.
 - future enhancement - extrapolate solution chains (find, make, consume, etc.)
 - future enhancement - create new solutions from related solutions
 - future enhancement - create new solutions from knowledge
